Additional thanks to BunnyTrack mapper NuLL for contributing ideas, testing and feedback.

### Description
This is an updated version of UT BunnyTrack player OwYeaW's [BTPortalGun](https://github.com/bunnytrack/OwYeaW-UScript-Archive/tree/master/BTPortalGun_beta_v1) mod. Several new features have been added as well as a fairly significant bug fix:

* Firing portals is no longer broken when attempting to fire the gun before the "weapon switch" animation has finished
* New animated portal textures and portal enter/exit visual effects
* Portals now interact with triggers
* Several new actors which interact with portals, e.g. a portal-destroying trigger which can remove portals when players exit a room
* Now available to use a mutator

For the full change log, see [BTPortalGun_Instructions.uc](Classes/BTPortalGun_Instructions.uc).

With thanks to UT player VRN|>@tack!< (aka Kaos Richie/Richard Nazarian) for spending many hours improving the original mod and patiently fixing bugs. Much of his progress was live streamed on his Twitch account at https://www.twitch.tv/kaosrichie
